## What platform?

MaterialEffects is an app for Android Marshmallow and newer (API level 23).

## What programming language?

 - App logic is written in Java language
 - App UI elements are organized in XML files

## What (human) languages?

The app and the code is fully translated into:
 - English
 > **Future:** it will be translated into **Norsk Bokmål** because jeg elsker dette språket!

## Why?

I want to show some awesome things possible with the Android and share the way how to do these.


## What in the future?

 - Rewritten in Kotlin,
 - As I mentioned before: **Norsk Bokmål** translation,
 - Sound effects,
 - UI improvements (custom-built look for tablet devices)
 - Maybe Flutter


## Cheers!
